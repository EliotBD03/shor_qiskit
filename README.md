# Shor's algorithm

Shor's algorithm is an algorithm for integer factorization. Here, we implemented
a very simple version of the algorithm for breaking RSA, in other words for the
prime factorization problem. It was done using Qiskit version 1.0.1, so using
the newer structure of the library.

You can find the code for shor in the file `rsa_shor.py` and a very simple brute
force algorithm in the file `rsa_brute_force.py`. There also is a
`rsa_compare.py` file to plot the time differences on several pre-computed
values.

There also is a short code for bell inequalities in the file
`bell_inequalities.py`. Also implemented using Qiskit version 1.0.1.
